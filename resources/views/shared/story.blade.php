            <flux:text class="mt-2">Fleur walks a path that entails trouble. Despite her beauty, what lies within is a child of the wind, someone who is capable
                of standing strong amongst a gale. Despite being surrounded by distasteful men, she remains unbothered with her feet planted as if she views herself
                as someone who is on equal footing. Not only was she unbothered, however, she was in search of a challenge. “Women didn't usually play with men, so the
                evening that Fleur drew a chair to the men's table without being so much as asked, there was a shock of surprise”
                (<a href="https://www.soarnorthcountry.com/images/upload/fleur-erdrich.pdf">Fleur</a>). These acts of bravery by a Native American
                woman who is challenging boundaries that should not exist represent the courage fueled by her lineage.  </flux:text>
