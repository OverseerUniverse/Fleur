            <flux:text class="mt-2">Fleur is a powerful and mysterious Ojibwe woman who defies societal norms. She is described as someone who “kept the finger of a
                child in her pocket and a powder of unborn rabbits in a leather thong around her neck” (<a href="https://www.soarnorthcountry.com/images/upload/fleur-erdrich.pdf">Fleur</a>).
                Fleur vitalizes courageousness when in face of perverted men, awakens ferocity in the way she lives life on the edge unapologetically, and she is resilient to the oppression that
                her ancestors have too faced both as a woman and a Native American. She is a character forced to sharpen just for existing.
