                        <i>Fleur</i> means <i>flower</i> in French and carries heavy symbolic weight throughout the
                        story. Fleur is deeply nested in her environment, which is a wild, natural setting. I imagine Fleur to represent a wild rose, thorned and rooted
                        in deep dark waters. Erdrich does not explicitly compare her to a specific flower, but she rather compares her character to a wild and resilient spirited
                        animal with “black fangs, ... hooves, ... and strikes hard as a snake” (<a href="https://www.soarnorthcountry.com/images/upload/fleur-erdrich.pdf">Fleur</a>).
